# 🏥 Hospital Data Analytics Project

## 📊 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital data using SQL to uncover insights that can help improve operational efficiency, optimize patient care, and inform strategic decision-making.

Using structured queries, we explored billing, treatment durations, insurance trends, and departmental performance to support data-driven improvements in healthcare management.

## 💼 Business Case
Hospitals generate large volumes of data daily, yet many decisions are still made based on intuition rather than evidence. This project aims to demonstrate how hospital management can leverage SQL-based data analysis to:

- Reduce patient length of stay
- Understand departmental billing trends
- Improve resource allocation
- Optimize insurance claim management

---

## ❓ Business Questions
1. What is the average length of stay for patients?
2. Which department generates the highest billing?
3. How many patients are covered by each insurance provider?
4. What are the total billing amounts by department?
5. What is the average medication cost per patient?

- **DBMS** (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin)
- **Hospital Dataset** (CSV or SQL-based import)
- **PowerPoint** (for presentation)

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the value of structured data analysis in a healthcare setting. With well-designed SQL queries, hospital management can make smarter, evidence-based decisions to improve outcomes and efficiency.
